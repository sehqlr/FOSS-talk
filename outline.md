# FOSS: Licencing Innovation

[Introduction Small Talk]

In this talk, I'm going to introduce you to the concepts, philosophy, and
effects of free and open source software licencing and how this relates to you
as you move forward with your code-writting careers.

N.B. this topic can get quite political, philosophical, and personal. Therefore,
these interpretations of the central ideas of the FOSS movement are my own, and
not endorsed by any organization.

## What is FOSS?

FOSS means Free and Open Source Software. At it's core, it is a group of
philophies that believe that users have rights to the control over their
computer systems, and a set of licences that govern those freedoms and
responsibilties.

These ideas are opposed to propietary, or closed-source
software. Propietary software can be gratis or sold, and your rights and
responsibilites are governed by EULAs, you know those long boring documents and
you just click through? Does DCMA and DRM strike any bells?

So the philosophic argument here is about what the users be allowed to do with
software? Can and should you be allowed to hack a Chromecast? 

Free Software grants these

* Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
* Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it
do what you wish.
* Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
* Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements
(and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community
benefits.

In order to be able to achieve Freedoms 1-3, the source code for the software
must be available, not just the compiled, binary versions.

Note, that there is no mention of software pricing in these freedoms. These
freedoms implicitly include the freedom to charge, which runs counter to how
most people think of free software, meaning "without paying money."
This confusion has lead to this phrase that tries to clarify: "Free as in
speech, not free as in beer." Another is to use Latin: "Libre" versus "Gratis."
Naturally, if someone bought your software, and used Freedom 2 to redistrubute a
copy freely to their neighbor, there goes your monetization strategy!
So, the cost of Free Software would trend to 0 over time.

Open Source Software 

Free Software as a concept was invented by Dr. Richard M. Stallman in the early
80's
This is called "Open Source."

III. Licensing
        0. Copyright and IP
        I. Copyleft v. Permissive
        II. No licence?
IV. Why does it matter?
        I. Web Dev: super important
