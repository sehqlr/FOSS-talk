# FOSS: Licencing Innovation

## Introductory Small Talk

## End User License Agreements

How often do you accept the terms to a EULA without even reading it?
Do you ever actually know what you actually agree to when you are signing your
life away in an EULA? How many of you are lawyers? That's not what you are here
for, is it? You are here to make software, and most people only want to use the
apps that let them look for a date for tonight or Instagram their lonely dinner.

The EULA, intellectual properties laws at large (such as DMCA) and 
common practices such as DRM and data-locking, distributing files and programs
in binary formats, all of these things form the set of rules and practices
that define how proprietary software
software operates. And, these rules can change, over time or suddenly. They also
differ in different countries, depending upon their customs.
However, this is not the only it has always worked, and I would argue that this
is no longer the preferred methodology in many cases.

In this talk, I'm going to introduce you to the concepts, philosophy, and
effects of free and open source software licensing and how this relates to you
as you move forward with your code-written careers.

N.B. this topic can get quite political, philosophical, and personal. Therefore,
these interpretations of the central ideas of the FOSS movement are my own, and
not endorsed by any organization.

## What is FOSS?

FOSS means Free and Open Source Software. At it's core, it is a group of
philosophers that believe that users have rights to the control over their
computer systems, and a set of licenses that govern those freedoms and
responsibilities.

So the philosophic argument here is about what the users be allowed to do with
software? Can and should you be allowed to hack a Chromecast? 

### Early Days

During in the mid-20th century, Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie developed UNIX, a
proprietary operating system for AT&T Bell Labs. Because AT&T wasn't allowed to
get into the non-telephone business due to a 1958 legal agreement with the
Department of Justice< , they weren't able to monetize UNIX, and had the 
obligation to license out the software. Ken Thompson started sending out copies 
of the source code on request.

Many of the early UNIX developers identified with the counterculture of the
early 70's, and their sharing made an impact on UNIX itself. To quote Douglas
Comer:
> Many universities contributed to UNIX. At the University of Toronto, the
> department acquired a 200-dot-per-inch printer/plotter and built software that
> used the printer to simulate a phototypesetter. At Yale University, students
> and computer scientists modified the UNIX shell. At Purdue University, the
> Electrical Engineering Department made major improvements in performance,
> producing a version of UNIX that supported a larger number of users. Purdue
> also developed one of the first UNIX computer networks. At the University of
> California at Berkeley, students developed a new shell and dozens of smaller
> utilities. By the late 1970s, when Bell Labs released Version 7 UNIX, it was
> clear that the system solved the computing problems of many departments, and
> that it incorporated many of the ideas that had arisen in universities. The
> end result was a strengthened system. A tide of ideas had started a new cycle,
> flowing from academia to an industrial laboratory, back to academia, and
> finally moving on to a growing number of commercial sites.

### Free Software

Free Software as a concept was pioneered by Dr. Richard M. Stallman in the early
80's, and in many ways is foundational to the FOSS movement. 

Free Software grants these

* Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
* Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make 
it do what you wish.
* Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
* Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements
(and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community
benefits.

In order to be able to achieve Freedoms 1-3, the source code for the software
must be available, not just the compiled, binary versions.

Note, that there is no mention of software pricing in these freedoms. These
freedoms implicitly include the freedom to charge, which runs counter to how
most people think of free software, meaning "without paying money."
This confusion has lead to this phrase that tries to clarify: "Free as in
speech, not free as in beer." Another is to use Latin: "Libre" versus "Gratis."
Naturally, if someone bought your software, and used Freedom 2 to redistrubute a
copy freely to their neighbor, there goes your monetization strategy!
So, the cost of Free Software will trend to 0 over time.

### Open Source Software 

As the Free Software Movement was adopted by more people, it does what ever any
other passionate, philosophical groups do: splinter.
In the late 90's, a group of people with disagreements with Stallman,
not in the technical side of things, but rather in the legal and social site,
decided to differenciate themselves with the term Open Source Software.

LAMP/LEMP/MEAN stacks
Vagrant boxes and Docker comtainers
Nearly every programming language that is used today (increasingly, even MS)
Popular frameworks and DB systems are also FOSS

Can a FOSS Licence be revoked? What are the consequences?
